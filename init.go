-> go build test.go => Builds test.go and outputs an executable named test (then you can run as ./test)

Build Tags
 	In Go, a build tag, or a build constraint, is an identifier added to a piece of code that determines
 	when the file should be included in a package during the build process.

 	https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/customizing-go-binaries-with-build-tags

 	It is a line comment starting with // +build and can be executed by:
 		go build -tags="foo bar"

 	Build tags are placed before the package clause near or at the top of the file followed by a blank line or other line comments.

 	- This trailing newline is required, otherwise Go interprets this as a comment (instead of a build tag).
 	- Build tag declarations must also be at the very top of a .go file. Nothing, not even comments, can be above build tags.
 	- Build tag boolean logic is as follows:
 		Build Tag Syntax			Build Tag Sample			Boolean Statement
		Exclamation point elements	// +build !pro				NOT pro
		Space-separated elements	// +build pro enterprise	pro OR enterprise
		Comma-separated elements	// +build pro,enterprise	pro AND enterprise
		Newline-separated elements	// +build pro				pro AND enterprise
									// +build enterprise

		Possible build calls of sample (pro, enterprise tags):
			go build // builds all that does NOT HAVE a tag
			go build -tags pro // builds all the src that have pro tag
			go build -tags enterprise // builds all the src that have enterprise tag
			go build -tags enterprise,pro // builds all the src that have both pro AND enterprise tag
			go build -tags "enterprise,pro" // builds all the src that have both pro AND enterprise tag
			go build -tags "enterprise pro" // builds all the src that have pro OR enterprise tag

	"fmt" // A package in the Go standard library.

// Notice that variable names come first then comes the types
// https://blog.golang.org/declaration-syntax
// => Basically says Go's type syntax is easier to understand than C's, especially when things get complicated.
// => Declerations are more readible now as they can be easily read left to right. It's always obvious which name is being declared - the name comes first.
// => The distinction between type and expression syntax makes it easy to write and invoke closures in Go, e.g:
// sum := func(a, b int) int { return a+b } (3, 4)
// Also notice return type is after the parens
